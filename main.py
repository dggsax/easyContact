                for all of your First Year Students. Some of them may not have phone
                numbers or emails, but they definitely have at least one. If, for some
                reason, a contact doesn't have either an email or a phone number, please
                reach out to either Chelsea or Taylor (or myself, since I have the data)<br/><br/>
                <b>How to install contacts on iPhone</b><br/>
                If you have an iPhone, all you need to do to install the contacts is to click
                on the attachment in this email. Then, a window should pop up on your screen
                that says information about only one contact, ignore this and click the <em>share</em>
                button in the top right hand corner and then select the option 'Copy to Contacts'.
                Then, just make sure to click the option that says "Add all n contacts" and there you go!
                <br/><br/>
                Assuming all works well and my code isn't jank, you should be able to search 
                for your first years in the Contacts app by looking up "Blue 13" (if you are the OL
                for group Blue 13). Feel free to create your own contact group!

                <b>How to install contacts on Android</b><br/>
                For the first time in all of human history, android is better at something 
                than iPhone. All you need to do is click on the attachment and android
                will import the contacts and even create a contact group for you named 
                '#Color #Number First Year'
